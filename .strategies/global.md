# Strategy: Global

## Approach: Three pools
Main idea:

> Coin Pool <- => Crypto Gold Pool <- => Money Pool

In long term accumulate value in CG Pool, draining it from Coin Pool with small portions and low risks.
Wait for CG Eruption and only then transfer most funds to Money Pool.

Wait until price drops - start a new cycle.

### Coin Pool
Coin pools are all assets except CG.
Most coins correlate in grows and drops with Bitcoin. But with wider ranges.
Which gives an opportunity to earn on conversions.

#### Risks:
- high liquidity (fast grows/drops)
- low level of capital, so easier to manipulate
- very dynamic
- risks higher than for CG
- pump and dump spikes
- drop to zero

In general this pool mostly is bad for accumulating value, but good for speculating on liquidity.
Frequent grows and drops give high waves to surf on.

#### Tactics:
Convert CG to other coins when they are on low CG rates, and convert back on high CG rates.
Ignore regular rates. No long-term investments. Short cycles. Daily trades.
Main goal - accumulate value from other coins in CG.

#### Requires:
- select promising coins
- dynamically calculate CGR, CGR baselines, CGT per coin
- high data accuracy
- continuously monitor rate (every 15 minutes)
- quick response / reaction
- low amounts mean low loss

### Crypto Gold Pool (CG Pool)
#### Risks:
- Low
- Legal restrictions on operations
- Lose account
- Stock is dumped

#### Tactics:
- CG Pool accumulates value pumped from other coins.
This pool is considered as a low risk pool for value.
It's meant to hold and accumulate value for years.
- Funds should be massively transferred to Money Pool only on CG Eruption event.
- Pumping with it's funds in Coin Pool should be in low amounts to reduce a risk of losing everything.
- Top Up from Money Pool on huge drops

#### Requires:
- select CG from coins
- define CG Eruption criteria
- set amount available for pumping in Coin Pool
- track balance

### Money Pool
End goal is to save most value accumulated on the market in this pool and rise all investments.
Top up on periodic basis (every month). It's funds are used to top up CG Pool.
