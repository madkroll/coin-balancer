# Strategy: Calm

## Idea
When market is calm - buy trusted coins and then wait for a CG to grow to sell on higher CG rates.
Ignore CG drop, just wait.

## Goal
Increase CG value

## When
- 3 days CG price stays in threshold -10% / + 10% (no growth / no drop)

## What
- open new trades in trusted coins
- for each trade - CG baseline
- value structure: CG 30%, 70% equally spread across trusted coins
- set CG targets / alerts
- monitor CG rate growth, send alert if close to CG target
- when target reached and crossed - track growth (high frequency) and convert everything to CG if any drop appears
